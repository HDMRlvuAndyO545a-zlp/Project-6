    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm using this as a way to organize my thoughts on a book I'm reading: "*1984*." by George Orwell 
        (also known as Eric Arthur Blair). Doing this mostly because I'm currently reading this for English
         and it'd be nice to get my thoughts in order. With that in mind I'll need to look at</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The story so far</li>
        <li>What we (I) know about the setting</li>
        <li>The context of when the story was *initially* written</li>
        <li>And the writing style, because as someone who writes has a hobby the amount of detail said speaks volumes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Not in that particular order of course, I'm writing this as I go. Anyway, I guess a good place to start would be</p>

     <strong> The Context!</strong>
     <p>...because from his point of veiw 1984 was the future, and everyome had weird ideas for the future. </p>
     
     <h2>Context</h2>
     <p>Time for a crash course in everything you need to know about the man:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Had a few run-ins with the Soviets</li>
        <li>Not a fan of the Nazis</li>
        <li>Died before 1984, his book was a cautionary tale so people don't let it happen</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>And that's about it. You really don't need to know much about him to understand the story, and even 
         if yyou had no idea who he was it is still possible to understand why it was written, which I find very nice.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5USpsvsNJw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Setting"/>

    <p>The setting takes place in a dystopian "future" (when it was written) where the world consists of three countires: 
        Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. The book follows Winston, a member out the Outer Party.Within the Outer Party,
        he enjoys luxuries such as: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Victory gin</li>
        <li>Two minutes of hate</li>
        <li>The prescence of the Thought Police</li>
        <li>The beauty of Newspeak (which is English but most of the words have been removed)</li>
        <li>Rations for food, tobacco, and chocolate</li>
        <li>Clothing coupons to buy that extra pair of overalls for Christmas</li>
        <li>The everwatching telescreen. Who watches who is irrelevant</li>
        <li>The constant feeling of mob mentality, where anyone who speaks out if immediately handed over to the police</li>
        <li>The knowledge that a war has been waged since the beginning of the country, and that everything good in 
            the world is due to the omnipotent wisdom and foresight of Big Brother.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And such novel phrases, such as:</p>

    <blockquote><strong> War is peace</strong></blockquote> 
    <p>

    </p>


    <p>Isn't the place just <em>lovely</em>? Oh, and Oceania is essentially the Soviet Union, but in Britain. And the 
        United States. and Australia, along with parts of Africa. <strong> Everywhere else</strong> is either part of 
        another country, or being fought over in a neverending war.
    </p>

    <h2>The Story so Far</h2>
    <img src="https://slideplayer.com/slide/783024/3/images/2/The+plot+so+far+%E2%80%A6.jpg" alt="The Plot so far"/>

    <p>Unfortunately, I <strong>have not</strong> (as of this moment) read the full story. However, I have read enough to <em>predict</em> 
        where the story is going, based on the amount of pages remaining and how little has been done so far. 
        And on top of that, I'm only here to talk about wjat I've read, adding speculation would only be a 
        disservice to those who want a summary.
