    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm using this as a way to organize my thoughts on a book I'm reading: "*1984*." by George Orwell 
        (also known as Eric Arthur Blair). Doing this mostly because I'm currently reading this for English
         and it'd be nice to get my thoughts in order. With that in mind I'll need to look at</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The story so far</li>
        <li>What we (I) know about the setting</li>
        <li>The context of when the story was *initially* written</li>
        <li>And the writing style, because as someone who writes has a hobby the amount of detail said speaks volumes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Not in that particular order of course, I'm writing this as I go. Anyway, I guess a good place to start would be</p>

     <strong> The Context!</strong>
     <p>...because from his point of veiw 1984 was the future, and everyome had weird ideas for the future. </p>
     
     <h2>Context</h2>
     <p>Time for a crash course in everything you need to know about the man:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Had a few run-ins with the Soviets</li>
        <li>Not a fan of the Nazis</li>
        <li>Died before 1984, his book was a cautionary tale so people don't let it happen</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>And that's about it. You really don't need to know much about him to understand the story, and even 
         if yyou had no idea who he was it is still possible to understand why it was written, which I find very nice.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5USpsvsNJw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Setting"/>

    <p>The setting takes place in a dystopian "future" (when it was written) where the world consists of three countires: 
        Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. The book follows Winston, a member out the Outer Party.Within the Outer Party,
        he enjoys luxuries such as: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Victory gin</li>
        <li>Two minutes of hate</li>
        <li>The prescence of the Thought Police</li>
        <li>The beauty of Newspeak (which is English but most of the words have been removed)</li>
        <li>Rations for food, tobacco, and chocolate</li>
        <li>Clothing coupons to buy that extra pair of overalls for Christmas</li>
        <li>The everwatching telescreen. Who watches who is irrelevant</li>
        <li>The constant feeling of mob mentality, where anyone who speaks out if immediately handed over to the police</li>
        <li>The knowledge that a war has been waged since the beginning of the country, and that everything good in 
            the world is due to the omnipotent wisdom and foresight of Big Brother.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And such novel phrases, such as:</p>

    <blockquote><strong> War is peace</strong></blockquote> 
    <blockquote><strong> Freedom is slavery</strong></blockquote> 
    <blockquote><strong> Ignorance is strength</strong></blockquote> 
    


    <p>Isn't the place just <em>lovely</em>? Oh, and Oceania is essentially the Soviet Union, but in Britain. And the 
        United States. and Australia, along with parts of Africa. <strong> Everywhere else</strong> is either part of 
        another country, or being fought over in a neverending war.
    </p>

    <h2>The Story so Far</h2>
    <img src="https://slideplayer.com/slide/783024/3/images/2/The+plot+so+far+%E2%80%A6.jpg" alt="The Plot so far"/>

    <p>Unfortunately, I <em>have not</em> (as of this moment) read the full story. However, I have read enough to <em>predict</em> 
        where the story is going, based on the amount of pages remaining and how little has been done so far. 
        And on top of that, I'm only here to talk about wjat I've read, adding speculation would only be a 
        disservice to those who want a summary.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the event that whoever is reading this has not read the book, it a pdf could be found
        <em><a href="https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/1984.pdf">here</a></em>
    </p>

    <p>Now then, the story thus far can be summarized as follow:</p>

    <p>Winston Smith, our middle aged protagonist, is a member of the Outer Party in Oceania, meaning he's say... middle class. 
        The thing is the place is completely controlled by "The Party" (yes, just "The Party", mostly the Inner Party though) and 
        everywhere there are posters, propaganda, and telescreens which the police use to watch people. This sounds bad enough, but 
        it gets worse because everyone is fine with everything nd believes every word the party says to the point of ignoring any 
        and all facts. Naturally, Winston does not like this and sets forth to hopefully keep his sanity in a world full of lunatics 
        obsessed with the Party, and with the head of the Party, Big Brother.
    </p>
    <p>After a bit of world building with the "Two Minutes of Hate," which is made to incite anger against Oceania's enemies, and
         some minor character interaction, Winston goes home. His home is an old apartment building which is a rundown building. 
         Not that amyone would care of course, doing so would be an insult to Big Brother. Anyway, Winston starts a diary and after 
         realizing he has no idea what he's writing (due to the Party's efforts of erasing independent thought) he writes a greeting 
         to whoever reads the book in the future.
