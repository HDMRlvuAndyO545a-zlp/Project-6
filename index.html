    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm using this as a way to organize my thoughts on a book I'm reading: "*1984*." by George Orwell 
        (also known as Eric Arthur Blair). Doing this mostly because I'm currently reading this for English
         and it'd be nice to get my thoughts in order. With that in mind I'll need to look at</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The story so far</li>
        <li>What we (I) know about the setting</li>
        <li>The context of when the story was *initially* written</li>
        <li>And the writing style, because as someone who writes has a hobby the amount of detail said speaks volumes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Not in that particular order of course, I'm writing this as I go. Anyway, I guess a good place to start would be</p>

     <strong> The Context!</strong>
     <p>...because from his point of veiw 1984 was the future, and everyome had weird ideas for the future. </p>
     
     <h2>Context</h2>
     <p>Time for a crash course in everything you need to know about the man:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Had a few run-ins with the Soviets</li>
        <li>Not a fan of the Nazis</li>
        <li>Died before 1984, his book was a cautionary tale so people don't let it happen</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>And that's about it. You really don't need to know much about him to understand the story, and even 
         if yyou had no idea who he was it is still possible to understand why it was written, which I find very nice.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5USpsvsNJw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Setting"/>

    <p>The setting takes place in a dystopian "future" (when it was written) where the world consists of three countires: 
        Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. The book follows Winston, a member out the Outer Party.Within the Outer Party,
        he enjoys luxuries such as: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Victory gin</li>
        <li>Two minutes of hate</li>
        <li>The prescence of the Thought Police</li>
        <li>The beauty of Newspeak (which is English but most of the words have been removed)</li>
        <li>Rations for food, tobacco, and chocolate</li>
        <li>Clothing coupons to buy that extra pair of overalls for Christmas</li>
        <li>The everwatching telescreen. Who watches who is irrelevant</li>
        <li>The constant feeling of mob mentality, where anyone who speaks out if immediately handed over to the police</li>
        <li>The knowledge that a war has been waged since the beginning of the country, and that everything good in 
            the world is due to the omnipotent wisdom and foresight of Big Brother.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And such novel phrases, such as:</p>

    <blockquote><strong> War is peace</strong></blockquote> 
    <blockquote><strong> Freedom is slavery</strong></blockquote> 
    <blockquote><strong> Ignorance is strength</strong></blockquote> 
    


    <p>Isn't the place just <em>lovely</em>? Oh, and Oceania is essentially the Soviet Union, but in Britain. And the 
        United States. and Australia, along with parts of Africa. <strong> Everywhere else</strong> is either part of 
        another country, or being fought over in a neverending war.
    </p>

    <h2>The Story so Far</h2>
    <img src="https://slideplayer.com/slide/783024/3/images/2/The+plot+so+far+%E2%80%A6.jpg" alt="The Plot so far"/>

    <p>Unfortunately, I <em>have not</em> (as of this moment) read the full story. However, I have read enough to <em>predict</em> 
        where the story is going, based on the amount of pages remaining and how little has been done so far. 
        And on top of that, I'm only here to talk about wjat I've read, adding speculation would only be a 
        disservice to those who want a summary.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the event that whoever is reading this has not read the book, it a pdf could be found
        <em><a href="https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/1984.pdf">here</a></em>
    </p>

    <p>Now then, the story thus far can be summarized as follow:</p>

    <p>Winston Smith, our middle aged protagonist, is a member of the Outer Party in Oceania, meaning he's say... middle class. 
        The thing is the place is completely controlled by "The Party" (yes, just "The Party", mostly the Inner Party though) and 
        everywhere there are posters, propaganda, and telescreens which the police use to watch people. This sounds bad enough, but 
        it gets worse because everyone is fine with everything nd believes every word the party says to the point of ignoring any 
        and all facts. Naturally, Winston does not like this and sets forth to hopefully keep his sanity in a world full of lunatics 
        obsessed with the Party, and with the head of the Party, Big Brother.
    </p>

    <p>After a bit of world building with the "Two Minutes of Hate," which is made to incite anger against Oceania's enemies, and
         some minor character interaction, Winston goes home. His home is an old apartment building which is a rundown building. 
         Not that amyone would care of course, doing so would be an insult to Big Brother. Anyway, Winston starts a diary and after 
         realizing he has no idea what he's writing (due to the Party's efforts of erasing independent thought) he writes a greeting 
         to whoever reads the book in the future. 
    </p>

    <p>Fast forward a bit. Chocolate rations have "increased" from 30 grams to 20, Winston has a friend named Syme who is probably 
        too smart to live, and his neighbor, Parsons, is Pro-Party to the point that it's all he thinks about. Parons' kids? Also 
        Pro-Party, to the point of fanaticism. Have enough of "Oceania is horrible" yet? Too bad! The food is bland and scarce, 
        the alcohol tastes horrible, clothes are rare, and dispite the Party saying they overproduced shoes by two million Winston 
        has been wearing the sme shoes for ages. Something good? Winston realizes that a girl has been watching him lately. Here's 
        hoping it isn't the Thought Police.
    </p>

    <p>Skipping <em>all the details</em> because I don't think it's that relevant, Winston is with the Proles. Who are the 
        Proles? Well, according to the Party they aren't people, but they're the equivalent of Oceania's lower class. He's down 
        there because the Proles have more independent thought than the Party members. Why? Because they aren't human and therefore 
        can be left alone. Winston knows this  so he went down there to see if anyone knows what life was like before the Party, no 
        one does, he goes into the shop where he bought the diary despite knowing the Thought Police might get him, meets the owner, 
        buys a bit of coral encased in glass. His task done, he goes outside to find <em>gasp</em> the girl from last time! 
        After contemplating murder Winston decides to go home and dread his existence.
    </p>

    <p>Several chains of events later, the girl is named Julia, she actually likes Winston. Some meetings, "interactions" and months 
        later, they decide to move in together. You know the shop from earlier? THe owner let them rent a room, which is nice 
        considering how there isn't a telescreen to watch them. A bit of time after that, Syme is gone, no one mentions him. Then in 
        comes O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party that Winston trusts for some reason. Winston gets invited to his house, he and 
        Julia go, O'Brien says he's a member of an organization that's against the Party (the Brotherhood), he says they can join, 
        foreshadowing that was references 4 chapters ago occurs, end chapter. 
    </p>

    <p>Days later, Winston gets a book that he's supposed to read to be accepted into the Brotherhood, he reads half of it. The next 
        day the Thought Police storm his house and it turns out that the owner of the shop was a member of the Thought Police, meaning 
        that Winston's been had the moment he entered the shop. Winston and Julia get taken away to be interrogated. Several character 
        interactions to emphasize how twisted the Party is later, torture happens. As in, almost Nazi concentration camp torture. Yes, 
        it was that bad. Anyway it turns out that O'Brien is tortuing him now because everything he said days ago was a lie and he was 
        loyal to the Party. After Winston tries to apply common sense and logic to O'Brien, the man counters by saying that everything 
        the Party says is true because majority rule. Gravity? Doesn't exist, the Party can float if they wanted to, but they don't 
        because there's no reason. Fossils? Don't exist, it was made up. The Party controls everything, humans control everything, 
        there is nothing before are after humanity and everything that is reality in inside Oceania. Winston obviously can't handle 
        an argument with a madman and gives up trying to argue. Some psychological and physical torure later, he comes out as a "free" 
        man, now knowing that 2 + 2 is 5, and that all his memories in the past weren't real. His memories of his mother? Didn't 
        happen. He then spends his days drinking extreme amount of alcohol, wishing for death, and loving Big Brother like the 
        magnificent savior he is. Julia? Oh, she's fine. Probably in the same boat as Winston, but she's irrelevant because Winston 
        doesn't love her anymore. Long live Big Brother, for he is the past, present and future. He who controls the past controls 
        all, and Big Brother controls everything, because anything outside Oceania doesn't matter. 
    </p>

    <p>Once again, if you have not read the book I suggest you read <em><a href="https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/1984.pdf">
        the pdf</a></em> before I start looking too far into this and completely misunderstand what I'm reading.
